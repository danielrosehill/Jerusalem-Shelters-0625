# Edits to original emergency shelter data (Jerusalem Municipality)

List of edits to original dataset imported from the website of the Jerusalem Municipality on June 19, 2025:

- Original categorisation replaced with a simple 1, 2, 3 system (shelters, car parks, schools with sheltering places)
- Unpopulated fields removed  
- Geolocations and addresses preserved  
- A "full address" field was added which appends ", Jerusalem, Israel" to the local location names in the original dataset to facilitate accessing the locations in geonavigation apps
